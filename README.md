Using Selenium to automate the process of getting our internet speed then using those numbers and creating a tweet. I don't think I'll ever get over how amazing Selenium is. It is amazing watching my code run automatically and seeing it click through and enter items. So fascinating! Also, I used OOP again(finally), I neglected it for a while but I thought it would be a good time to tocuh up on my OOP skills and it does make code look so much more readable and accessible. This project was fun and not too hard, I enjoyed this one!
